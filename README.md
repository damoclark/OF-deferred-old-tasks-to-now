# DeferredOldTasksToNow #

DeferredOldTasksToNow is an Applescript that can be integrated with the Omnifocus Task Management Software from Omnigroup.  The script scans all projects and action groups in the front OmniFocus document identifying any that
	have a defer date prior to today, and updates their defer date to today so they remain in the Forecast Perspective view.
